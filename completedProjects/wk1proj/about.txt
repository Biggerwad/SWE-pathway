### **Project: Task Manager (CLI-based)**  
#### **Features:**  
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Save tasks to a file so they persist after closing the program  

#### **Steps to Build It:**  
1. **Create a Python script (`task_manager.py`).**  
2. **Use a list of dictionaries to store tasks:**  
   ```python
   tasks = []
   ```
3. **Implement functions for:**  
   - Adding tasks  
   - Viewing tasks  
   - Marking tasks as done  
   - Deleting tasks  
   - Saving/loading tasks from a file  
4. **Use a simple menu for user interaction:**  
   ```python
   while True:
       print("\nTask Manager")
       print("1. Add Task")
       print("2. View Tasks")
       print("3. Mark Task as Done")
       print("4. Delete Task")
       print("5. Exit")
   ```
5. **Use `json` or `pickle` to save and load tasks persistently.**
